# Y Modules Manifesto

## Core Principles

We, the developers and contributors of the Y Modules ecosystem, embrace and commit to the following principles:

### 1. The Three Whales Doctrine

Every line of code, every function, and every module must adhere to:

- **Zero Redundancy**: No superfluous code, libraries, or dependencies
- **Minimal Requests**: Only essential interactions with databases, servers, APIs, and browsers
- **Maximal Performance**: Optimisation for speed in both perception and reality

### 2. Minimalist Architecture

- A module shall do one thing exceptionally well
- A module shall not reinvent what already exists within the ecosystem
- A module shall be removable without catastrophic system failure

### 3. Strict Standards Compliance

- All code must adhere to established coding standards
- All interfaces must be clearly defined and strictly typed
- All modules must pass automated validation before implementation

## Module Development Guidelines

### Design Principles

1. **Purpose-driven**: Each module must solve a specific problem without scope creep
2. **Self-contained**: Minimise dependencies between modules
3. **Stateless when possible**: Prefer pure functions and immutable data
4. **Testable**: Every module must include comprehensive tests
5. **Documented**: Clear documentation is not optional

### Technical Requirements

1. **Strict Typing**: Use the strongest type system available in your language
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and informative errors
3. **Security-first**: Consider all possible attack vectors
4. **Forward-compatible**: Design for future extensibility

### Performance Standards

Every module must:

1. Add zero or negligible performance overhead to the system
2. Respond within 100ms for user interactions
3. Optimise for the critical rendering path
4. Implement proper caching strategies where applicable

## Interface Compliance

### API Design

1. **RESTful**: Follow REST principles for all HTTP interfaces
2. **Versioned**: All public APIs must be versioned
3. **Backward-compatible**: API changes must not break existing implementations
4. **Well-documented**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for all endpoints

### Front-End Integration

1. **No DOM manipulation** outside Web Components
2. **CSS isolation** using Shadow DOM or equivalent
3. **Accessible** according to WCAG AA standards minimum

## WebAssembly Guidelines

WebAssembly modules must:

1. **Offload complexity**: Move heavy computations away from the main thread
2. **Integrate seamlessly**: Provide JavaScript bindings that feel native
3. **Optimise size**: Keep .wasm modules as small as possible
4. **Be defensive**: Handle all edge cases and memory management properly

## Module Development Life Cycle

1. **Conceptualisation**: Define the problem and proposed solution
2. **Specification**: Create detailed specifications and acceptance criteria
3. **Development**: Build according to the guidelines
4. **Testing**: Unit, integration, and performance testing
5. **Peer Review**: Critical assessment by senior developers
6. **Validation**: Automated compliance checking
7. **Release**: Versioned and documented deployment
8. **Maintenance**: Ongoing support and updates

## Adaptation Guidelines

### WordPress Adaptation

1. Must not hook into Core unless absolutely necessary
2. Must follow WordPress coding standards where not in conflict with Y Modules standards
3. Must be compatible with major WordPress versions (current and previous)
4. Must work in standard WordPress environments without modification

### Other Platform Adaptations

1. Respect the host platform's architecture and philosophy
2. Minimise platform-specific code
3. Implement clean abstraction layers
4. Provide clear migration paths

## The Code as Craft Commitment

We regard code as craft, not commodity. Each line written should reflect:

- **Elegance**: The most elegant solution is often the simplest
- **Efficiency**: Resources are precious and should not be wasted
- **Effectiveness**: The solution must solve the real problem, not just address symptoms
- **Endurance**: Code should be written to last, not as temporary scaffolding

## The Community Pledge

As contributors to the Y Modules ecosystem, we pledge to:

1. **Share knowledge** freely and constructively
2. **Mentor newcomers** with patience and clarity
3. **Accept criticism** gracefully and apply it diligently
4. **Attribute work** properly and recognise contributions
5. **Evolve continuously** as technology and best practices advance

---

This manifesto serves as both compass and anchor for all who contribute to the Y Modules ecosystem. By following these principles, we create not just code, but a lasting foundation for web development that prioritises performance, security, and maintainability above all else.

**The right way is often the harder way. Excellence is our standard.**
